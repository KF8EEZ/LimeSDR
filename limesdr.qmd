Continuous frequency range: 100 kHz â€“ 3.8 GHz

The LimeSDR uses a LMS7202M sdr chip documented here <https://github.com/myriadrf/LMS7002M-docs>

This discussion link <https://discourse.myriadrf.org/t/rf-connection-10-u-fl-connectors-6-rx-4-tx/305/9> has information about the RF matching network used on the LimeSDR:

::: {.callout-tip}
LMS7002M has 3x Rceiver RF inputs and 2x Tx output per channel. By design receiver inputs are tuned as follows:

LNAL - from 0.1 MHz to 2000 MHz. Gives a noise figure <2dB.
LNAH - from 1500 MHz to 3800 MHz. Gives a noise figure <3dB.
LNAW - from 0.1 MHz to 3800 MHz. Gives a noise figure 5-7dB. Usually used for sniffing.
Transmitter output bu design are similar and supported frequency range is form 0.1-3800 MHz.

However, every RF input/output is combined with RF matching network which might be band specific. On the LimeSDR the RF inputs/outputs are tuned for:

LNAL - is tuned for 800 - 900 MHz (3GPP Band V).
LNAH - is tuned for 1900 MHz (3GPP Band I).
LNAW - has broadband matching up to 2000 MHz.
TXout1 - is tuned for 2600 MHz (3GPP Band VII) .
TXout2 - has broadband matching up to 2000 MHz.
The matching network includes broadband Balun + network for fine tune for specific band, hence can be easily modified.

The LMS7002M synthesizer frequency range is from 30 MHz - 3800 MHz. We are using internal NCO to get us to 100 kHz region.
